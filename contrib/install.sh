# By the way, I make a prompt for the install folder and save into ~/.config/kbmsgr and in uninstall I
# would use that folder. Yes, that summs up what I can do in shell now.
#
# oh, wait.. I don't know how to read from stdin... I'm useless =(
#
# But I make good ideas. And long descriptions. =P
# And I cantually can read from a parameter, so it's not a big deal that I can't read from stdin ^_^
#
# Very long descriptions!
#
# I will delete it later... Just don't have much to do now, while memtest is running on Arch...

cp -v ../src/kbmsg* /usr/local/bin/

# yes, it's one line now... but it works!
